    Observation: the bridge's fields (OBS_FIELDS in client.py), n_rays terrain distances, the last PREV_ACTIONS actions
    (newest first), how long the pot has gone without headway (as a share of stall_steps; 0 without a cutoff), then how
    far it is behind the episode's progress record (the reward only pays beyond it).
    Action: mouse movement in [-1, 1]^2, as a player's mouse: the game's controller moves its cursor by it (with its own
    acceleration and smoothing) and drives the hammer head toward the cursor. A still mouse lets the cursor settle on
    the head: the hammer goes loose.
    Reward: progress_reward (new ground along the level route, by default only that), minus a time penalty per step.
    Raw height would pay for hopping in place; the route first goes right, over the lakeside rocks.
    Episodes end when the pot falls in the lake or wins (with snake_ends, also when it touches the Snake, a frictionless
    chute from beside the bucket down to the start: in training, a death to avoid), and are truncated after
    stall_steps without headway (if set):
    progress hasn't risen 1 above its lowest point since. Climbing back after a fall counts; perching or rocking in a
    hole doesn't. With stall_ends=False the count starts over instead, so a test episode goes on and the policy still
    gets the stuck signal it trained with. Wrap in TimeLimit for a time limit.
    reset(options={"state": id}) starts an episode from a saved state instead of the bottom; {"place": distance} puts the
    climber on the route there first (training starts beyond where the agent gets on its own), and "dx" moves it
    sideways from the route (where the route runs through a ledge the pot can only sit beside).

        render_mode="rgb_array" makes render() return the frame the game drew after the last step.
        record_reset: for continuous play (no episodes): when the pot falls more than this below the record, the
        record restarts from where it is, as a training episode would after a rewind. The observation's last field
        (how far below the record) then stays in the range the networks trained on: after falls from 230-290 to ~105
        it read ~125, and networks that climb from there 50/50 times froze for the rest of an hour.
        game_args: extra launch flags, e.g. ["-goi-colliders"] to draw the physics shapes over the game.
        props: after the rays, the nearest loose prop within 12 of the pot (the bucket on its rope, the hat): 1, its
            offset and velocity from the pot, the sine and cosine of its rotation, its spin (8 fields; train.Player drops
            them for a network from before, and a warm start gives them zero weights).
        headless: without rendering, run the game with no window or graphics device (client.start; by default only with
            GOI_HEADLESS=1); False for a game that will turn rendering on later (start_rendering).
        action_cost: subtracted from the reward times the mean squared action, so big mouse moves have to pay off.
        mouse: mouse input at action 1.
        recovery, regress, air_bonus, speed_bonus: progress_reward's weights.
        held_records: new ground pays only while the pot or the hammer touches something, so a mid-air peak pays
        nothing unless the climber lands or hooks there: flinging for height and falling earned up to 8 below the
        chapel, where players climb "slow but sure".
